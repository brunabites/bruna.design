## Bruna Bites, Product Designer Portfolio

Hey, there! This is my [personal portfolio](https://bruna.design/) built based on  
[Ekom Enyong amazing site](https://github.com/ekomenyong/kommy-mdx) remixed, using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, & MDX via Contentlayer. I wanted to used simple mdx as content for my site, like (contentlayer)[https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer], and looking for example in Github found this precious thing Ekom built. I've changed it to serve as portfolio and fit my needs.

### Want to use?

Feel free to check things, remix and serve as you want. But have in mind that all content, color schemes, and images are my property. ALso, remeber to follow [original license](https://github.com/ekomenyong/kommy-mdx/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).
