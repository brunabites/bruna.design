## Bruna Bites, Product Designer Portfolio

Hey, there! This is my [personal portfolio](https://bruna.design/) built based on [Ekom Enyong amazing site](https://github.com/ekomenyong/kommy-mdx) remixed, using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, & MDX via Contentlayer.

I wanted to use simple markdown (.mdx) as content for my site since I'm usign Obsidian to take notes. I've found about [contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer), and looking for examples I've found this precious thing Ekom built. I've changed it to serve as a portfolio and to fit my needs.

### Want to use?

Feel free to check things, remix and serve as you want. But have in mind that all content, color schemes, and images are my property. Also, remeber to follow [original license](https://github.com/ekomenyong/kommy-mdx/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).
